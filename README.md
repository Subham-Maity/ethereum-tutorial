# BlockChain A-Z Part 2
## You Can Follow My Own All Research About Blockchain If You Are A Complete Beginner

# Writer Intro
I am **Subham Maity**
I love Programming. One of the aims I had when I started ```CodeXam``` was to make learning programming easy.

Actually, I was working on this project then I did research and made many projects and then I thought why not make a detailed documentary on it then I started making the documentary which is completely free .

# Basic 

## 1. Who is the founder of Ethereum ?
```text
Vitalik Buterin
```
## 2. Why did Vitalik created Ethereum ? 
```text
He wanted to create a new and improved version of Bitcoin that allowed for more scalability and applications with an ambitious vision to radically re-architect the web
```
## 3. Bitcoin Vs Ethereum ? 

#### We use bitcoin as a cryptocurrency nothing more than that but when we come to Ethereum it's a very powerful even programs can run top on the blockchain.

## 4. Technology vs Protocol/Coin vs Token 

#### 1. This technology is nothing but this is blockchain (Distributed immutable Ledger ).

#### 2. These protocols are nothing but this Ethereum Bitcoin Wave Neo.These are the nothing but these are the rule. Ethereum Bitcoin Wave Neo everything has a different set of rules. 

#### 3. Token are used in ICO(Initial Coin Offering).Coins directly represent a proposed medium of exchange. On the other hand, tokens represent an asset.

- [ ] 1. Distributed mutable ledger
- [ ] 2. Centralized Immutable Ledger
- [ ] 3. Distributed immutable ledger

2. What is Ethereum ?
- [ ] 1. Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.
- [ ] 2. Ethereum is a decentralized, private blockchain with smart contract functionality.
- [ ] 3. Ethereum is a centralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.

**Answer**
```
1.Distributed immutable ledger 2.Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.
```



# Ethereum Accounts

## 1. Why we need Ethereum Acc ?

### 1. If we want to transact ether or receive ether then we need an account that is ethereum account like bank account. 

### 2. There are 2 types of ethereum account one is externally owned account(EOA) and second is contract account (CA)



| Type 1                        | Type 2                |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Externally Owned Account(EOA) | Contract Account (CA) |


## 2. How we create EOA ?

* ### Whenever we create a wallet we can create EOA.It can be a Metamask Wallet,My Ether Wallet or Any Wallet.
* ### Also, we can see our ether balance in that wallet 


* #### What Is Private Key ?
* #### The private key grants complete ownership of and access to any funds kept on your ethereum address, including any ETH or ERC20 tokens that you might have.

        </p>


## 3. What is CA ?

### With CA we can send ether receive ether and also interact with smart contract.

#### This is our Address.What is ethereum address you can access your ethereum account.

#### This is our contract account address.We will discuss this later in this article

## 5. EOA vs CA



| Type 1                            | Type 2                              |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Externally Owned Account(EOA)** | **Contract Account (CA)**           |
| Private key is needed             | No private or public key is needed. |
| Controlled by humans              | Controlled by code.                 |
| No Gas is associated              | Gas is associated.                  |
| Has a unique address              | Has a unique address.               |
| Holds ETH balance                 | Holds ETH balance.                  |


* **Explain Little** 

  * gas- When we created contract account we need a certain amount of cash (fees)   
  * Both needs unique address 
  * Both can hold ethereum balance 



## Basic QuiZ 2 (**Answer below**)
1.What is a smart contract ? 
- [ ] 1. A "smart contract" is a document for Ethereum Blockchain.
- [ ] 2. A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Bitcoin blockchain.
- [ ] 3. A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.


**Answer**
```
3. A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.
```
# Smart Contract

## 1. Why is it called smart contract?

### 1. A set of promises(agreement), specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises

### 2. It is just a program

### 3. A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.



#### Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and they can send transactions over the network. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible
