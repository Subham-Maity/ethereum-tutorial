# BlockChain A-Z Part 2
## You Can Follow My Own All Research About Blockchain If You Are A Complete Beginner

# Writer Intro
I am **Subham Maity**
I love Programming. One of the aims I had when I started ```CodeXam``` was to make learning programming easy.

Actually, I was working on this project then I did research and made many projects and then I thought why not make a detailed documentary on it then I started making the documentary which is completely free .

## 1. Who is the founder of Ethereum ?
```text
Vitalik Buterin
```
## 2. Why did Vitalik created Ethereum ? 
```text
He wanted to create a new and improved version of Bitcoin that allowed for more scalability and applications with an ambitious vision to radically re-architect the web
```
## 3. Bitcoin Vs Ethereum ? 

#### We use bitcoin as a cryptocurrency nothing more than that but when we come to Ethereum it's a very powerful even programs can run top on the blockchain.

## 4. Technology vs Protocol/Coin vs Token 

#### 1. This technology is nothing but this is blockchain (Distributed immutable Ledger ).

#### 2. These protocols are nothing but this Ethereum Bitcoin Wave Neo.These are the nothing but these are the rule. Ethereum Bitcoin Wave Neo everything has a different set of rules. 

#### 3. Token are used in ICO(Initial Coin Offering).Coins directly represent a proposed medium of exchange. On the other hand, tokens represent an asset.

# Ethereum Accounts

## 1. Why we need Ethereum Acc ?

### 1. If we want to transact ether or receive ether then we need an account that is ethereum account like bank account. 

### 2. There are 2 types of ethereum account one is externally owned account(EOA) and second is contract account (CA)



| Type 1                        | Type 2                |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Externally Owned Account(EOA) | Contract Account (CA) |


## 2. How we create EOA ?

* ### Whenever we create a wallet we can create EOA.It can be a Metamask Wallet,My Ether Wallet or Any Wallet.
* ### Also, we can see our ether balance in that wallet 


* #### What Is Private Key ?
* #### The private key grants complete ownership of and access to any funds kept on your ethereum address, including any ETH or ERC20 tokens that you might have.

        </p>


## 3. What is CA ?

### With CA we can send ether receive ether and also interact with smart contract.

## 5. EOA vs CA



| Type 1                            | Type 2                              |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Externally Owned Account(EOA)** | **Contract Account (CA)**           |
| Private key is needed             | No private or public key is needed. |
| Controlled by humans              | Controlled by code.                 |
| No Gas is associated              | Gas is associated.                  |
| Has a unique address              | Has a unique address.               |
| Holds ETH balance                 | Holds ETH balance.                  |


* **Explain Little** 

  * gas- When we created contract account we need a certain amount of cash (fees)   
  * Both needs unique address 
  * Both can hold ethereum balance 



## Basic QuiZ 2 (**Answer below**)
1.What is a smart contract ? 
- [ ] 1. A "smart contract" is a document for Ethereum Blockchain.
- [ ] 2. A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Bitcoin blockchain.
- [ ] 3. A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.


**Answer**
```
3. A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.
```
# Smart Contract

## 1. Why is it called smart contract?

### 1. A set of promises(agreement), specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises

### 2. It is just a program

### 3. A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.



#### Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and they can send transactions over the network. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible

## 1. What are the decentralized applications ?

 ```javascript
 DApps or decentralized apps are just the opposite of centralized apps. 
 The decentralized apps run on the blockchain or Peer to Peer (P2P) 
 networks of computers rather than central servers
 ```

### How does decentralized app work?

 ```javascript
To use the decentralized apps, instead of downloading the application, 
the user has to pay a certain amount(in terms of the cryptocurrency) to the developer.
 The user can also download the source code of the application under a 
 “smart contract”- a collection of code, logic, and data to run the application. 
 Unlike centralized apps, the backend code of the decentralized application runs on 
 the P2P network instead of the centralized servers. 
 ```
###  How to Build a decentralized app?
 ```javascript
The development process of dApp is different than the centralized ones. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to build a decentralized application.

1.List the app requirements and check them for their feasibility.
2.Install the Node Package Manager.
3.Choose your tech stack, including database, frameworks, hosting, frontend, its contracts, and programing language, APIs, and Development server. You can use Ethereum for the same.
4.Launch an Initial Coin Offering to raise the funds that you will need to develop your project.
5.Build your dApp using the platforms like truffle.
6.Test your dApp and smart contract for its functionality.
7.Once tested successfully, you can launch the dApp
 ```

        </p>

## 2.  What are Centralized Applications?

 ```javascript
 Applications that are controlled by a single individual or business are known as centralized apps. 
 In these applications, information always flows through a single server or cluster of servers. 
 The dedicated server contains all the required logic to execute an application. 
 This enables it to execute the desired action as well.Since the app is controlled by a centralized server, 
 the chance of it crashing increases. When the server goes down or crashes, 
 the app stops working across all user devices until the problem is resolved.

 ```
###  How Centralized apps work?
 ```javascript
With the centralized approach, the user downloads the app from the app store and uses 
the app by sending the request/information to the centralized server or cluster of servers. 
Upon receiving the request, the server processes it and sends out the response accordingly.
 ```
###  How to Build a Centralized App?
 ```javascript
If you want to develop a centralized app for your business, the following steps can help you with the same.

1.Select Your Launch Platform that is Android or iOS.
2.List down the features that you want to include in your application and create a wireframe accordingly.
3.Design and create a prototype of your application to test it for basic functionalities.
4.Once approved, build your application with the help of the app builder.
5.Test the application for its functionality.
6.Now your app is ready to launch.
 ```

## 3. Why should you build a dApp over a regular app?


 ```javascript
1.Zero downtime is guaranteed.
2.More Secure as the malicious actors cannot launch attacks like 
denial-of-service on the individual DApps.
3.Offers absolute privacy as a dApp can be 
deployed and used without requiring real-world identity verification.
4.Gives you greater control over the application.
5.Provides complete data integrity.
 ```

| Centralized Apps | Decentralized Apps |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Not Trustworthy  | Trustworthy        |
| Censorship       | No Censorship      |
| You pay          | They pay           |
| Can go down      | Cannot go down     |
