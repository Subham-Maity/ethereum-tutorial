# BlockChain A-Z Part 2
## You Can Follow My Own All Research About Blockchain If You Are A Complete Beginner

# Writer Intro
I am **Subham Maity**
I love Programming. One of the aims I had when I started ```CodeXam``` was to make learning programming easy.

Actually, I was working on this project then I did research and made many projects and then I thought why not make a detailed documentary on it then I started making the documentary which is completely free .

## 4. Technology vs Protocol/Coin vs Token 

#### 1. This technology is nothing but this is blockchain (Distributed immutable Ledger ).

#### 2. These protocols are nothing but this Ethereum Bitcoin Wave Neo.These are the nothing but these are the rule. Ethereum Bitcoin Wave Neo everything has a different set of rules. 

#### 3. Token are used in ICO(Initial Coin Offering).Coins directly represent a proposed medium of exchange. On the other hand, tokens represent an asset.

# Ethereum Accounts

## 1. Why we need Ethereum Acc ?

### 1. If we want to transact ether or receive ether then we need an account that is ethereum account like bank account. 

### 2. There are 2 types of ethereum account one is externally owned account(EOA) and second is contract account (CA)



| Type 1                        | Type 2                |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Externally Owned Account(EOA) | Contract Account (CA) |


## 2. How we create EOA ?

* ### Whenever we create a wallet we can create EOA.It can be a Metamask Wallet,My Ether Wallet or Any Wallet.
* ### Also, we can see our ether balance in that wallet 


* #### What Is Private Key ?
* #### The private key grants complete ownership of and access to any funds kept on your ethereum address, including any ETH or ERC20 tokens that you might have.

## 3. What is CA ?

### With CA we can send ether receive ether and also interact with smart contract.

| Type 1                            | Type 2                              |

| No Gas is associated              | Gas is associated.                  |
| Has a unique address              | Has a unique address.               |
| Holds ETH balance                 | Holds ETH balance.                  |
